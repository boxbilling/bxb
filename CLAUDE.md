# Instructions


All code must have tests. Coverage is enforced at 100%.

**CRITICAL: Before every commit, you MUST run `make lint` and `make test-cov` and confirm they pass. Never commit or push code that fails linting or tests. A pre-commit hook enforces this, but you should also verify manually before staging a commit.**

```bash
# Before every commit (enforced by pre-commit hook)
make lint
make test-cov
```
